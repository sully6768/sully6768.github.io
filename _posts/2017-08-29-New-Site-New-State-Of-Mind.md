It has been a while since I've written. For what ever reason; lazy, busy, kids, grandkids, excuses, etc. Maybe though I had just convinced myself I didn't have anything worthwhile to share. 

Recently I was reminded, through a spirited dialog regarding MSAs (microservices) with a colleague, that knowledge unshared is the antithesis of learning (spoilers). 

And if I am unwilling to share what I have learned as well as allow myself to receive feedback upon my own speculations and musings, then have I actually learned at all or have I just built a paper kingdom for my ego?
