title: What''s New in JBoss Fuse 6.3
---

JBoss Fuse 6.3 released recently and contains a number of updates.  They include:

* New versions included for Apache Camel (2.17), Apache CXF (3.1), and Jetty (9)
* New components including Kubernetes, Slack, ServiceNow, Apache Spark, PDF and Paho.



Over the next month or so I will be stepping through a number of the updates to give you an idea of what the impacts are of each addition are.

So where to start...  

IMHO probably one of the biggest improvements, from a developers perspective, are the tooling updates for the Fuse IDE.  To start with JBoss Fuse IDE  get a greatly improved graphical diagram editor 

It might be easier to go through and get hands on to give you a better idea of how much its improved.

To start with lets get it installed. For the hands on portion I will be using the JBoss Developer Studio 9.x environment which is based on Eclipse.

To install the tooling for JBoss Fuse open the Red Hat Central screen which can be accessed by clicking the Red Hat logo on the tool bar:
